This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

Challenge
Motivation
Diplomacy is rapidly changing in our digital era. As people move more freely, technologies like AI, AR/VR and big data are reshaping how we connect, and younger generations expect faster, more digital interactions with public institutions. Embassies must adapt, especially where physical locations aren’t possible, due to geopolitical conflicts or remote locations. Virtual embassies can make consular services, cultural exchange, and international cooperation more accessible and secure, reaching people anywhere and enabling real-time, inclusive dialogue.
Task
Your challenge is to rethink what an embassy can be in the 21st century. You don’t need to rebuild an entire embassy. Instead, focus on a single service, function, or use case that does not exist, you find interesting, important, you see potential for improvement or ideally all together.
Consider questions like:
How can essential diplomatic or consular services be made more accessible or user-friendly?
What new possibilities could a digital or virtual embassy offer that weren’t possible before?
How can we ensure the integrity and security of these services?
How can we keep real-world and digital diplomacy connected?
You can choose to focus on solutions for citizens (such as emergency help, visa applications, or information access), for diplomats (such as secure communication, immunity, or host-government liaison), or both.
Some examples of classic embassy functions:
Issuing passports, visas, and travel documents
Assisting citizens in emergencies
Providing legal or notarial services
Advocating for citizens’ rights
Giving information and advice
Facilitating official communication and negotiation
Organizing diplomatic events or meetings
Addressing diplomatic privileges and security
Final tip: Work on the idea that truly excites you and come at it with fresh eyes. Don’t just copy an existing solution or put a paper form online, re-imagine an existing service for the digital era or invent something entirely new. Big or small, what matters is the real-world impact for citizens and diplomats and how naturally your solution lives in the digital space

Examples
US embassy in Iran (link)
After the U.S. and Iran severed diplomatic ties in 1979, the United States launched the “Virtual Embassy Tehran” to maintain a direct channel with Iranian citizens despite the absence of a physical embassy. This web-based platform provides reliable information about the U.S., its policies, educational opportunities, and consular services, aiming to foster dialogue and cultural exchange. The virtual embassy helps overcome geopolitical barriers, supports public diplomacy, and ensures access to critical resources for Iranians, demonstrating how digital embassies can sustain engagement, build trust, and deliver essential services when a traditional diplomatic presence is not possible.
Maldives 2022 (link)
In 2022, the Maldives expanded its digital diplomacy by launching a virtual embassy in the Metaverse, building on its earlier Second Life initiative. This Metaverse embassy offers a persistent, interactive platform where users worldwide can access consular services, obtain country information, and engage with Maldivian culture and policy in real time; even if they lack access to a physical embassy. Services include virtual consultations, information on visas and travel, cultural showcases, and opportunities for dialogue with officials.

<file path="features.md">
Great focus! The **visa process** is one of the most frustrating, paperwork-heavy, and often opaque aspects of embassy services. Rethinking it for the digital era offers a **huge opportunity for innovation**.

---

## 💡 Groundbreaking Idea: **VisaLegatio – A Smart, Transparent, AI-Guided Visa System**

### 🔍 Summary:

**VisaLegatio** is a **secure, AI-driven, globally unified visa experience** that replaces the traditional visa application process with an intelligent, interactive journey — accessible anytime, anywhere, on any device.

---

## 🧠 Key Innovations:

### 1. **AI Visa Assistant (AVA) – Your Personal Visa Guide**

* Chat + voice assistant trained on **country-specific visa laws**, frequently updated with **policy changes**.
* Speaks your language and understands your background.
* Can **pre-screen your case**, explain requirements in plain language, and auto-fill forms with your consent.

> “Hi Ana, based on your travel history and employment documents, you are eligible for a short-term cultural exchange visa. Let’s begin the pre-approval now.”

---

### 2. **Dynamic Form Generator**

* Instead of long static PDFs, VisaLegatio uses an **adaptive form system**:

  * Asks only relevant questions.
  * Changes dynamically as you answer.
  * Skips irrelevant sections (e.g., no need to ask about children if you’re 19 and traveling alone).

---

### 3. **Auto-Validated Digital Docs & Credentials**

* Uses **OCR + AI verification** to check passports, bank statements, and employer letters.
* Accepts **verifiable credentials** (like digital diplomas, company IDs, etc.) from trusted issuers — reducing fraud and speeding up approval.
* Integrates with **global travel history records** (e.g., via IATA, Interpol) for faster background checks.

---

### 4. **Real-Time Status Transparency + Pre-Decision Simulator**

* Replaces “Your visa is being processed” with a **real-time progress bar** + clear checklist:

  * ✅ Identity verified
  * ✅ Income confirmed
  * ❌ Travel insurance missing
  * 📍 Officer review in 3 days
* Includes a **decision simulator** with probabilities:

  > “Based on current data, your approval likelihood is 82%. Adding a letter of support from your employer may improve your chances.”

---

### 5. **Embassy-In-The-Cloud Appointments**

* Integrated **secure video interviews** with embassy officials.
* Supports **multi-language interpretation**, facial emotion reading (for security), and encrypted document sharing.

---

### 6. **One-Click Repeat Applications**

* For frequent travelers, your visa “profile” can be reused.
* Auto-renewal options for common short-term travel visas.

---

## 🛡️ Security + Privacy by Design:

* Built on **zero-knowledge proofs** and **end-to-end encryption**.
* Your data is only visible to the consular officer reviewing it.
* Blockchain-stored receipts and proof-of-submission for every interaction.

---

## 🌐 Future Possibility:

* Partner countries could adopt **mutual VisaLegatio protocols**, reducing red tape for multi-country travel (like a **digital Schengen** for the future).
* Could integrate with **e-wallets** for digital visa stamps or travel tax payments.

---

## 🎯 Real-World Impact:

* Cuts application time by **60–80%**.
* Reduces embassy workload and fraud.
* Increases transparency, trust, and access for low-tech users via **voice-first UI** and **mobile optimization**.
* Helps refugees, nomads, or displaced persons who lack a fixed address but need legal mobility.
