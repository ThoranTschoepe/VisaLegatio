Challenge
Motivation
Diplomacy is rapidly changing in our digital era. As people move more freely, technologies like AI, AR/VR and big data are reshaping how we connect, and younger generations expect faster, more digital interactions with public institutions. Embassies must adapt, especially where physical locations aren’t possible, due to geopolitical conflicts or remote locations. Virtual embassies can make consular services, cultural exchange, and international cooperation more accessible and secure, reaching people anywhere and enabling real-time, inclusive dialogue.
Task
Your challenge is to rethink what an embassy can be in the 21st century. You don’t need to rebuild an entire embassy. Instead, focus on a single service, function, or use case that does not exist, you find interesting, important, you see potential for improvement or ideally all together.
Consider questions like:
How can essential diplomatic or consular services be made more accessible or user-friendly?
What new possibilities could a digital or virtual embassy offer that weren’t possible before?
How can we ensure the integrity and security of these services?
How can we keep real-world and digital diplomacy connected?
You can choose to focus on solutions for citizens (such as emergency help, visa applications, or information access), for diplomats (such as secure communication, immunity, or host-government liaison), or both.
Some examples of classic embassy functions:
Issuing passports, visas, and travel documents
Assisting citizens in emergencies
Providing legal or notarial services
Advocating for citizens’ rights
Giving information and advice
Facilitating official communication and negotiation
Organizing diplomatic events or meetings
Addressing diplomatic privileges and security
Final tip: Work on the idea that truly excites you and come at it with fresh eyes. Don’t just copy an existing solution or put a paper form online, re-imagine an existing service for the digital era or invent something entirely new. Big or small, what matters is the real-world impact for citizens and diplomats and how naturally your solution lives in the digital space

Examples
US embassy in Iran (link)
After the U.S. and Iran severed diplomatic ties in 1979, the United States launched the “Virtual Embassy Tehran” to maintain a direct channel with Iranian citizens despite the absence of a physical embassy. This web-based platform provides reliable information about the U.S., its policies, educational opportunities, and consular services, aiming to foster dialogue and cultural exchange. The virtual embassy helps overcome geopolitical barriers, supports public diplomacy, and ensures access to critical resources for Iranians, demonstrating how digital embassies can sustain engagement, build trust, and deliver essential services when a traditional diplomatic presence is not possible.
Maldives 2022 (link)
In 2022, the Maldives expanded its digital diplomacy by launching a virtual embassy in the Metaverse, building on its earlier Second Life initiative. This Metaverse embassy offers a persistent, interactive platform where users worldwide can access consular services, obtain country information, and engage with Maldivian culture and policy in real time; even if they lack access to a physical embassy. Services include virtual consultations, information on visas and travel, cultural showcases, and opportunities for dialogue with officials.
